# Autonomous Car Control System

A low-cost, low-power, high-speed Control System for Autonomous vehicles implemented on a FPGA. 
This system can control a Multi-Motor Electric Vehicle as well as additional sensors, more specifically, an optocoupler inside the tyres and ultrasonics around the vehicle, in order to provide basic autonomous functionality, such as an active safety and a cruise control system that helps the car avoid accidents and at the same time to facilitate better vehicle controllability and stability.

## Equipment used for testing

*  CMOD A7 - Development board
*  Electric vehicle toy - DC and Servo motor
*  2 Ultrasonic sensors - HC-SR04
*  Optocoupler - homemade using IR LED, a Photodiode and a Voltage comparator
*  PC - for manual input of speed and angle

### TODO

As of this moment this system requires manual input of speed and angle using UART, but this system was always meant to be connected to an AI with object detection, recognition and quick decision making capabilities that will enable it to use this system, to control a car and provide an autonomous driving experience.
